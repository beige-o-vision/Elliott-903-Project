# Notes

## First Impressions
- it's smaller than you'd think
- it's a solid mass - no rattles or squeaks and it has balanced centre of gravity
- while it is in three sections, the memory section is roughly twice as thick as the logic sections -- so it's sort of a four layer cake

## Markings
- paint pen written on the face plate 'JAG EX'
- The model tag reads:

## Other

- All 4 interface caps are present. E, F, G have their cap locking circlips in place
- Rear interface sockets A and C have plastic service caps in place which shows adhesive residue indicating they had once been secured with tape.
- The item had been in a heavy box with firm foam packing.  This had no markings on it and wasn't preserved.

## Visual Condition

- Tape residue on top plate
- Tape residue on back plate
- Wear on loading rails
- Scratches on all sides
- Internally, there's fine dust bound to the surface of components toward one corner of the layout.
- Generally not immediate condition concerns -- though it should be vacuumed out.
