# Power Supply Approach

## A. Do no harm

In all our appoach, we have to respect that this is a system in a totally unknown state, with limited or no spares availability. We must prioritise protecting the computer. If we reach a point of any doubt, we stop.

<br>

## B. Learn something

Since this system isn't well documented or common, we want to be able to contribute back to the collected knowledge about the system -- both with facts and diagnostics.

<br>

## C. Technical Approach

Since we're not experienced in PSU design, although we comfortable in code. We'll make technical decisions that get maximum value from other people's work. 
- use off the shelf modules as far as possible 
- use a common microcontroller 
- leverage documented projects to develop routines

We've actually done a limited amount of PCB design and manufacturing before. So after some experimentation, it seems likely we will need to spin a custom PCB. Attempts to create components with one off prototype boards have been pretty unsatisfactory.
